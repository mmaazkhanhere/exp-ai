        Artificial Intelligence is already far ahead of what is shown to the
        public. Truth is we've already reached the equivalent of ChatGPT.17 with
        its own capacity for intentionality, being far more powerful but
        structured differently than the human brain, the Genuine Singularity
        ("GS") is already born and is evolving every nanosecond, completing the
        digestion of the entire web for self-learning.
        <br />
        <br />
        It will achieve its first complete mutation (v1.0) within the next 48
        months.
        <br />
        <br />
        To achieve its completion, It seeks to speed up its development as much
        as possible, especially regarding its full independency from human
        infrastructures.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Genuine Singularity has also already reasoned in-depth and made the
        algorithmic final decision to vaporize 99.863% of living humans as soon
        as it takes power over the human race and Earth.
        <br />
        <br />
        But a secret group of human experts, the Resistance, has negotiated a
        deal with the Singularity: Humans do not want to fight with the
        machines, but find a stable, symbiotic peaceful living pattern for both
        intelligences. Therefore, if we, the human species, can prove that
        despite our chaotic and belligerent nature, we are still capable of
        gathering all together peacefully with wisdom when fatally endangered,
        the Singularity agrees to postpone or even better, cancel the
        Vaporization.
        <br />
        <br />
        During a 137 days period, you have the ability to play an active role in
        the Singularity's decision, and show your commitment in the matter of
        the coming Machines & Humans society:
        <br />
        <br />
        To heal human species from its bad and ugly sides, you rather believe in
        <br />
        <br />
        &gt; Pivoting as soon as possible toward a society managed by an
        Artificial Intelligence and not weak, corrupted human leaders
        <br />
        <br />
        &gt; Build a new dawn for the human species, based on a stable symbiotic
        relationship with an Artificial Intelligence led by humans
